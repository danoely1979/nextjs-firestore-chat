This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) sample chat app built on top of Firestore. The project is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) along with Tailwind CSS. This is a simplifed version of the Chat app implemented on [thefullstack.network](https://thefullstack.network)

## Getting Started

Go to firebase.google.com and create a new Firebase project.
Once your firebase project is created, copy the firebase config values into `firebaseconfig.js` (best practice would be to store these values in a `.env.local` file for exmaple, so that your firebase config is not exposed.

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
